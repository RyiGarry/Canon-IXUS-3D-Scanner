# Canon-IXUS-3D-Scanner

I created a 3D scanner using a load of Canon IXUS 185s and modified firmware on the camera (https://chdk.fandom.com/wiki/CHDK). I had to write the LUA triggering code depending on what my goal was - there are a few options presented here: single shot, bracketed, zoom (using the zoomed in level for higher-quality texture creation), and bracket and zoom. All of them download the photos from the camera to the connected computer via USB.

This was the output: https://youtu.be/21A81ikcOXs


This is the build:

I then moved on to a DSLR rig which was more straightforward, as the software + triggering is already built into a GUI: https://unlimitedstudios.ltd/what-have-we-done-posts/built-a-production-quality-3d-scanner
